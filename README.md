# üöó VinSpec - Vehicle Inspection Reports

VinSpec is a **React** application built with **TypeScript** that provides detailed and accurate **vehicle inspection reports**. It helps users make informed decisions when buying or selling cars by offering transparent, reliable, and easy-to-understand inspection data.

## üéØ Scope

VinSpec offers a **subscription-based** service for vehicle inspection reports, but for testing and demonstration purposes, it mimics the functionality of a **free version**. Users can access basic vehicle inspection information, with premium features available to subscribers.

### ‚ú® Key Features:
- **Vehicle Inspection Reports**: Get detailed reports about a vehicle's condition based on its VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).
- **Subscription Model**: While the app simulates a free service, it includes a subscription feature that provides more in-depth reports and advanced tools for users who sign up for premium access which is an idea for a future real-world project.
- **Real-time Data**: The app fetches vehicle data from an external API to provide the most up-to-date information about cars.

  **Note:** The data provided by the API in the free version might not always be fully accurate, as it relies on limited information from a free source. Some vehicle details may be incomplete or missing.
